## Intro to neural network architectures

This tutorial was given at the meeting of the Munich PyData group on 3.5.2018.  
It contains three sections:
* Dense layers
* Convolutional layers
* Recurrent layers

For the tutorial the MNIST dataset and Keras was used. 
It was not intended to create high performance models, in particular the models tend to generalize rather badly as no dropout has been used.  

The model visualisation in the 'vis' folder is work in progress and will be published as a separate GitHub project.
